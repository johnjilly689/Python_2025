# In the print() function, you output multiple variables, separated by a comma:

x="ravi"
y=5
z="newzealend"
print(x,y,z)

# You can also use the + operator to concatenate string  multiple variables, but you cannot concatenate string + number it will give type error:
x="ravi "
y= "shyam "
z="newzealend"

print(x + y + z) #Notice the space character after "ravi " and "shyam ", without them the result would be "ravishyamnewzealend".

# x="ravi"
# y=5
# z="newzealend"
# print(x + y + z)  # error code

# For numbers, the + character works as a mathematical operator:

x=5
y=10
print(x+10)

# The best way to output multiple variables in the print() function is to separate them with commas, which even support different data types:
